# Intel 8080 CPU implemented in Clash

This repository contains an Intel 8080-compatible CPU core implemented in Clash. The implementation 
comes with a software emulator for high-level testing / debugging, and a hardware-synthesizable version
for use in FPGA projects.

The design is described in detail in my book *Retrocomputing in Clash: Haskell for FPGA Hardware Design*,
avaliable at https://unsafePerform.IO/retroclash/.
